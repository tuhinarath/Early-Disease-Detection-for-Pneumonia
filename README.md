# Early-Disease-Detection-for-Pneumonia
Pneumonia Detection from Chest X-Ray Images using CNN

A deep learning–based system that classifies chest X-ray images as Normal or Pneumonia using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This project demonstrates how AI can assist in early detection of pneumonia by analyzing medical imaging data.

Project Overview

This project uses a custom CNN model trained on the Kaggle Chest X-Ray Pneumonia dataset.
The pipeline includes:

Data loading and preprocessing

Image transformations

CNN model design and training

Evaluation using Accuracy, Precision, Recall & F1-score

Visualization of predictions

The model achieved strong pneumonia detection recall, making it useful for preliminary screening.
